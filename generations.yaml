    description: "The Volkswagen Arteon was introduced as a premium fastback sedan positioned above the Passat in VW's lineup, effectively replacing the discontinued CC while moving further upmarket with more distinctive styling, enhanced technology, and increased interior space. Built on Volkswagen's modular MQB platform, the Arteon features dramatic, coupe-like styling with a sloping roofline, frameless doors, and a wide, horizontal front end with integrated LED headlights and a clamshell hood creating a premium, almost concept-car appearance that distinguishes it from the more conservative Passat. Available in fastback sedan and, following a 2020 refresh, Shooting Brake (estate/wagon) body styles in some markets, the Arteon emphasizes style alongside practicality with a spacious interior enabled by generous exterior dimensions and a liftback rear providing SUV-like cargo flexibility. Engine options vary significantly by market but typically include a range of turbocharged four-cylinder petrol and diesel units with power outputs from approximately 150 to 280 horsepower, plus the performance-oriented Arteon R introduced in 2020 featuring a 320 horsepower 2.0-liter turbo and all-wheel drive. Most variants come with front-wheel drive as standard with Volkswagen's 4MOTION all-wheel drive available on higher-powered models. Transmission choices include six-speed manual and seven-speed dual-clutch automatic options depending on engine and market. The interior blends elements from both the Passat and higher-end Volkswagen models with a horizontal dashboard design featuring a standard 8-inch or optional 9.2-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster (Digital Cockpit), and high-quality materials throughout. A significant facelift in 2020 brought updated exterior styling, a completely revised dashboard with touch-sensitive climate controls, enhanced technology including Travel Assist semi-automated driving capability, and the aforementioned Shooting Brake and R variants. The Arteon occupies an interesting position in Volkswagen's lineup as a near-premium offering blending avant-garde styling with practical versatility, appealing to buyers seeking a distinctive alternative to both mainstream and premium-brand competitors, though facing the same challenges as other sedan models in a market increasingly dominated by SUVs and crossovers."
