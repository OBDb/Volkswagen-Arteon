    description: "The Volkswagen Arteon was introduced in March 2017 at the Geneva Motor Show as a premium fastback sedan positioned above the Passat, effectively replacing the discontinued CC. Built on Volkswagen's modular MQB platform, the Arteon featured dramatic, coupe-like styling with a sloping roofline, frameless doors, and a wide horizontal front end. At launch in Europe, it offered three turbocharged engines: a 2.0L 280 PS TSI petrol and two diesel options with 150 PS and 240 PS. Additional engines including a 1.5L TSI Evo (150 PS) and both petrol and diesel 190 PS variants were introduced shortly after. The interior featured an 8-inch or optional 9.2-inch touchscreen infotainment system with available digital instrument cluster. The Arteon was built in Emden, Germany, and positioned as a more upmarket model than the CC it replaced. Front-wheel drive was standard with Volkswagen's 4MOTION all-wheel drive available on higher-powered models. Transmission options included six-speed manual and seven-speed dual-clutch automatic."

    description: "The Arteon received a significant facelift in 2020, bringing substantial updates across exterior styling, interior technology, and model range. A new shooting brake (estate/wagon) body style was introduced alongside the existing liftback. The performance-oriented Arteon R debuted, featuring Volkswagen's 2.0L TSI turbocharged petrol engine producing 320 PS (235 kW) and 420 Nm of torque, paired with a seven-speed DSG gearbox and all-wheel drive with a rear torque-splitting differential. A plug-in hybrid e-Hybrid variant was also launched, combining a 1.4L petrol engine with an electric motor for a combined output of 215 PS and approximately 50 km electric-only range. Interior updates included a completely revised dashboard with touch-sensitive climate controls, new digital instrument panel, and enhanced infotainment touchscreen. Advanced driver assistance features including Travel Assist semi-automated driving capability were added. The facelifted model continued with updated powertrains including a 300 PS version for the US market. Production of the sedan body style ended in 2023, while the shooting brake continues through 2026."
